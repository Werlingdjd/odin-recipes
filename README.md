24/06/2025 - Current Project is to create a recipe website, practising using HTML to create a basic website
<p>The focus of this project is getting familiar with various HTML elements</p>
<p>24/06/2025 - Project completed, 4 pages, appropriate links that work, images, ordered and unordered lists, different size headers, strong elements, alt text, simple paragraphs</p>
<p>Lacking aesthetically, but seems to function properly. Good practise for HTML elements and adding appropriate details.
