        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes (or whichever vessel you've chosen)</li>
            <li>1 cup of cooked rice</li>
            <li>Half a cup of cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of fresh basil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 190 degrees celcius (about 375 degrees fahrenheit).</li>
            <li>Cut the tops off the tomatoes and scoop out the insides, mince the garlic cloves and chop the basil.</li>
            <li>Combine the rice, cheese, half of the basil, and garlic in a bowl. Once thoroughly mixed, stuff the contents of the bowl into the tomatoes.</li>
